If an XCode project previously was under XCode source control

  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57847239/xcode-source-control-push-local-changes-stuck-on-loading
execute in the parent project
* cd <new project>
* rm .DS_Store
* sudo rm -R .git
  use sudo to avoid questions for lots of files
* rm .gitignore
* rm -R .swiftpm
  if exists
