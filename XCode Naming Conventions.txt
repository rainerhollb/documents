My XCode Naming Conventions

https://www.swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/#general-conventions
seems to make no restrictions about constants names.

https://google.github.io/swift/#apples-api-style-guidelines
is referencing to Swift conventions but makes more restrictions than Swift!

It is not useful to use the Jump To Definition or Show Quick Help features to read the code.

Naming constants and variables in same style result in badly readable code.
In all themes Colors are not different in XCode for constants and variables.

So I decided to use the Java convention to write constants completely in uppercase
and with underscores as a substitute for the glorious camelCase syntax. :-(

Types of constants and variables should be signaled by their names if possible.
* Bool: is...
* String: Use postfix ...Name, ...String or ...Text if ambiguity is possible or when it is useful.
* numbers: ?

XCode impressions:
* I do not understand why the colours of a variable differ between declaration and usage.
* The required class name or its abstraction "Self" for static variables is a very good idea. The 30 years old
  naming convention "their" for the statics becomes obsolete - although many people
  in the last decades relied on different colours or italic font in Java on Eclipse IDE.
