How To


... add XCode projects to GitHub Desktop

If an XCode project previously was under XCode source control
and you want to add it to this parent project
to avoid no longer in Xcode available repos after adding a new repo as described in
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57847239/xcode-source-control-push-local-changes-stuck-on-loading
execute in the parent project
* cd <new project>
* sudo rm -R .git
  use sudo to avoid questions for lots of files
* rm -R .swiftpm
  if exists
* add to .gitignore
 .DS_Store
 *.xcuserstat

XCode source control is not reliable:
* stashed changes can get lost
* old versions of main are listed
* XCode branch display does not notice a changed branch from Github Desktop when XCode source control is enabled. Else it does.


... get the console log in iOS

Maybe possible with the huge https://github.com/FLEXTool/FLEX project but it requires some maintenance to be adapted to the current iOS versions.
